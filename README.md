# Tappy makes you happy!

## What is tappy?
Tappy makes it easy to load and unload crypto assets into any object equipped with an NFC tag: a card, a pin, a bracelet, a sticker, etc. Using Tappy doesn't require any technical skills whatsover. Simply tap a device to load the wallet with assets, and tap again to spend them. No smartphone, no gas payment, no metamask, no browser-cached keys, no QR code scan...users don't even need the Internet.
